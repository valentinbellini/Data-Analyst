# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio repository. This collection showcases several end-to-end projects where I apply data analytics, data cleaning, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques. Each project is organized in its own directory and includes documentation, code, and data workflows.

Some of the tools I've used: *Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks), SQL, Google Sheets, Tableau and R*.

## PROJECTS

1. [Finance Portfolio Tracker](FinancePortfolioTracker/README.md) 

This project is built in Google Sheets, leveraging Google Finance functions and SQL-like queries for data transformation. It tracks investment operations (stocks, crypto, commodities, etc.) and generates a dynamic dashboard for performance monitoring.
Includes:
- Automated price tracking
- Portfolio performance metrics
- Operation history management
- Visual dashboard

2. [E commerce](E_Commerce/README.md)

A exploratory data analysis project developed in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to identify data quality issues, clean the dataset, detect outliers, and visualize key metrics.

Tools used: *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite.*

3. [MachineLearning](ML/EN-Summary.md)

A collection of exercises and summaries from the Microsoft Machine Learning Certification and additional university coursework.
Topics include:
- Regression & classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature preprocessing
- Basic ML workflows

4. [Argentine Vineyard Analysis](Argentina_Vineyard_Analysis\README.md)

A personal project using Python, SQL, and Tableau with public government datasets. The analysis focuses on vineyards in Argentina, exploring production, geographical distribution, and long‑term trends.

5. [Agricultura Argentina](AgriculturaArgentina/README.md)

A Spanish‑language data project diving into Argentina's agricultural sector. The workflow includes cleaning, feature creation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/valentin.bellini/viz/HistoriadegranosenArgentina/HistoricoSiembre#1).
